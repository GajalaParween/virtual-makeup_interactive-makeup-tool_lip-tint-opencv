# virtual-makeup_interactive-makeup-tool_lip-tint-opencv
"An interactive Python tool using OpenCV that allows users to apply custom lip tint to images by manually selecting lip regions and adjusting color and blur in real-time."
I developed an interactive virtual makeup application using OpenCV in Python, with expert guidance from Saxon Sir. This project showcases how to apply a custom lip tint to an image by selecting points around the lips.

ðŸ¤– Key features include:

- Interactive selection of the face region of interest (ROI)
- Manual polygon drawing around the lips, complete with an undo functionality
- Real-time control of lip tint color using HSV sliders
- Adjustable blur for a smoother appearance
- Masking to ensure the tint is applied only within the lip area
- Side-by-side comparison of the before and after results
- Ability to save the final output as an image
